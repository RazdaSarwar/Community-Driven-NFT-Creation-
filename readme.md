# Community-Driven NFT Creation

## Project Title
Community-Driven NFT Creation

## Project Description
This project aims to build a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows community members to propose, vote on, and fund the creation of new NFTs. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure a transparent and democratic decision-making process for NFT development.

Through decentralized governance, the community has direct influence over which NFTs get funded and developed, ensuring collective ownership and engagement.
